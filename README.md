# Notes
Based on the implementation by Lornatang , I am currently improving or fixing certain aspects of this implementation to make it work for my project.

This new implementation will alow different scale factors such as 4,8,16,32 and different patch sizes/ images sizes of the crop for the SRGAN of the original image. By default the model of SRGAN was designed to work for 96x96 crops as seen in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802), that limitation was problematic and additional modifications had to be done.

# PROJECT: Super Resolution for Histological Images
My project is looking in increasing the resolution of histological images by large scale factors (4,8,16,32). Histological images are usually very high in quality (can get to around 20l x 20k pixels in resolution) however it is very hard to optain them, time consuming and requires expensive hardware. Compared with CT and MRI images which are very low quality a super resolution neural network can help cut some of the time and cost of optaining them.

More changes to the code are expected. Histological results will be shown later, currently the original README results are accurate based on my testings.

**Abstract** <br>
Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution
using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem
remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we
super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based
super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective
function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared
reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise
ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually
unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the
higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial
network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first
framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling
factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists
of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our
solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is
trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original
photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by
perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual
network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled
images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows
hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores
obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images
than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.
